symbolic&#x2074 is a general-purpose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">computer algebra system</a> written entirely in C. It was originally conceptualized for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84_Plus_series#TI-84_Plus_CE_and_TI-84_Plus_CE-T">TI-84 Plus CE</a> calculators and is therefore designed to run even on systems with severe hardware limitations.
